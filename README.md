Spring 2017

This was my first project at ODU, like most firsts there were a lot of new challenges. For one it was the first 1500+ line of code project and my first class in C++. I didn't really honour the principle of good top down design and ultimately that led to the A.I. cars being buggy at the end.

The program: The program was to read in a user's own grid, then control one car and let the computer control two others. The cars would pick up momentum moving in spefic direction and hitting walls or other cars would then kill the momentum of the vehicles. I was successful in everthing but the A.I. due to lack of time to finish.

Objectives:
Top Down Design
C++ Interface Design
ADTs

To run compile each of the .cpp files
then run ./gridracers
